# Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Combo Website

## Overview

This is a small React application designed to help users look up different combos for various Smash Bros characters. It features a simple and responsive UI built with React, SCSS, and React Router, allowing users to navigate between character pages seamlessly.

This project is part of a learning course focused on API development, where the client fetches combo data from a custom Node.js & Express backend connected to an SQL database. The goal is to improve frontend skills while gaining hands-on experience with API integration and dynamic data handling
